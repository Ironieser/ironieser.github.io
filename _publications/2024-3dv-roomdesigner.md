This paper is about style-consistent and shape-compatible indoor scene generation. Indoor scene generation aims at creating shapecompatible, style-consistent furniture arrangements within
a spatially reasonable layout. However, most existing approaches primarily focus on generating plausible furniture  layouts without incorporating specific details related to individual furniture pieces. To address this limitation we  propose a two-stage model integrating shape priors into the indoor scene generation by encoding furniture as anchor latent representations.
